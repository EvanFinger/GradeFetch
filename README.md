# GradeFetch
A python program meant to "fetch" grades from canvas and calculate finals and GPA's. This is done by accessing the user's canvas profile through the canvas API, utilizing the canvasapi extention in python. It is then able to calculate finals and gpa's (as long as the user specifies credit values for each class).
